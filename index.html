Happy Birthday to the woman who has been my first home, my guide, my strength, and my forever safe place — my 
Behna❤️❤️

Some memories don’t fade with time; they quietly become a part of who we are. Our Sagar days — the chaloo days — all of it together, from last year, were not just moments, they were a feeling. Days filled with laughter, chaos, long conversations, shared silence, and the comfort of simply being together. That phase of life will always remain one of the warmest chapters of my heart.🫀

No matter how much life changes, some bonds remain untouched. Our mandatory Sunday calls still feel like home — same voices, same rants, same understanding. And somehow, even when we are miles apart, we still end up posting the same captions and the same stories, as if our bond has its own language that the world doesn’t need to understand. That simple familiarity, that unspoken sync, reminds me that distance never really changed us.🧿

Planning your wedding with you became one of the most emotional journeys of my life. From endless Pinterest boards, colour palettes, outfit ideas, décor dreams, and late-night discussions — every little detail felt personal. It wasn’t just wedding planning; it was us dreaming together. Being a part of this chapter made me realise how deeply connected our lives have always been and how much of my world has quietly been shaped around you.💓

And then came your wedding day. Watching you step into a new phase of life filled my heart with pride, happiness, and emotions I still don’t know how to put into words. You looked beautiful, strong, and full of grace. In that moment, I didn’t just see a bride — I saw my sister, the same one who has always protected me, guided me, and believed in me even when I doubted myself. That moment made me realise how deeply my world was shaped around you. That moment filled my heart with pride and a deep sense of gratitude.🥹

You always said, “I won’t cry at your wedding.” I told myself the same. But I did cry — quietly, softly, in moments I didn’t expect. Not because I was saying goodbye, but because I was realising how much you mean to me and how grateful I am to call you my sister.🥺

You’ve been my strength without ever announcing it, my comfort without being asked, and my constant through every change. Being your younger sister is something I’ll always be proud of.💝

As you celebrate another year of your life, I hope this new chapter brings you peace, happiness, and everything your heart deserves. May you always feel loved — because you truly are.🤍🤍

No matter where life takes us, remember this —
I’m always here. Especially for our Sunday calls.💗

Happy Birthday, Behnaa🫀✨
